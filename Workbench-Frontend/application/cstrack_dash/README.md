# CS-Track Dash visualizations

## Documentation (Work in progress)

### Standalone

The documentation for deploying this application as a standalone application can be found in [davidrol6.github.io/CSTrack_Docs](davidrol6.github.io/CSTrack_Docs)

### Within the workbench

When starting the Frontend of the analytics workbench the Dash application is also started. In order for Dash to work properly you need to
add the inputs to the **analytics-workbench/Workbench-Frontend/application/cstrack_dash/** [Input documentation](davidrol6.github.io/CSTrack_Docs/inputs.html).
