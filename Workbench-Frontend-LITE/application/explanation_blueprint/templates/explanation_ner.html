        <h1>What is NER?</h1>
        <p>
            Named Entity Recognition, short NER, is used to identify named entities in texts.
            Such as names of people, places or organisations as well as dates or numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this the unstructured text is first turned into a structured computational representation of text.
            Namely part of speech tagging is utilized to identify potential named entities.
            Additionally, capitalization rules and sentence structure are considered for this step.
            Next comes assigning types to the named entities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Workbench we use spaCy to do that. Spacy offers pretrained models for several languages.
            And can be used out of the box or can be additionally trained with training material.
